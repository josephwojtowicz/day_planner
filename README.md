# homework5

In this repo is my files for Homework #5, a simple day planner.

Using moment.js, the date and time are displayed at the top of 
the page. This clock is also used to show if the block of time 
between 9 AM and 5 PM is in the past, present, or future. These
units are determined by the colors grey, red, or green, respectively. 

When the user enters tasks into the field associated with a particular hour,
they can save the them by clicking the save button on the right side of 
the row. The text is saved to local storage so that if the window
is closed or refreshed the tasks remain.
